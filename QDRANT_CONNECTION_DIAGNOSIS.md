## Qdrant Connection Issue Diagnosis

Based on testing your Qdrant server `https://qvector.jneaimi.com`, here's what we found:

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **Server is reachable**: `curl` commands work perfectly
2. **Authentication is working**: Your API key `c1WL1fpY9rUI441zsGMfgONKaCFbaizY` is valid
3. **Collections exist**: Found collections "ils" and "hidden_pearls"
4. **RAG endpoint authentication**: The authentication layer is working correctly

### ‚ùå What's Not Working
1. **Qdrant Python client**: Hangs when trying to connect via `qdrant-client==1.7.0`
2. **Python HTTP clients**: Both aiohttp and the underlying HTTP connections are timing out

### üîß Potential Solutions

#### Option 1: Network/Environment Fix
The issue appears to be a network connectivity problem specific to Python HTTP clients from the server environment. This could be:
- DNS resolution issues in Python
- Firewall restrictions on Python processes
- SSL/TLS configuration problems
- Async client configuration issues

**Troubleshooting steps:**
1. Check if Python can resolve the hostname:
   ```python
   import socket
   print(socket.gethostbyname("qvector.jneaimi.com"))
   ```

2. Test with different Python HTTP libraries (requests vs aiohttp)

3. Check SSL certificate verification:
   ```python
   import ssl
   import certifi
   # Test SSL context
   ```

#### Option 2: Alternative Connection Method
Since curl works, we could implement a connection method that uses subprocess to call curl for operations:

```python
import subprocess
import json

def test_qdrant_connection_via_curl(url, api_key):
    result = subprocess.run([
        'curl', '-H', f'api-key: {api_key}', 
        f'{url}/collections'
    ], capture_output=True, text=True)
    return json.loads(result.stdout)
```

#### Option 3: Use Qdrant HTTP API Directly
Instead of the Qdrant Python client, implement direct HTTP API calls using requests or httpx with proper configuration.

### üöÄ Immediate Workaround

For now, the authentication system is working correctly. The connection issue is specific to the Qdrant client initialization, not the authentication layer.

You can proceed with:
1. Creating collections manually via curl or Qdrant dashboard
2. Using the RAG endpoints once the connection issue is resolved
3. The authentication will work correctly once connectivity is established

### Next Steps
1. Investigate the Python HTTP client connectivity issue
2. Consider implementing direct HTTP API calls instead of the Qdrant client
3. Test from a different environment to isolate the network issue
